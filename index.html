      <i> what is css </i> 
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> css :- css stand for cascading style sheet </li>

        </li>
        <li> css describes html . elements are to be displayed on screen .paper . or in othher media.</li>
        <li> <del> css is not necessary </del> <mark>  css saves a lot of work </mark> .it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>

        <li> <i> External stylesheets are stored in css files . </i></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 > <i>
    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways </i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements </li>

        <li> internal - by using a style element in the headd section </li>
        <li>external - by using a link element to link to a exsternal css file.  </li>
        <li> the most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files . however . <mark> in this tutorial we will          use inline and internal styles </mark> ,  beacause this is to demonstrate .andd easier for you to try it youerself
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        when comparing CSS class vs ID , the diffrance is that CSS class aplies style to multiple element .ID , on the
        other hand , apllies a style to one unique element . ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
        link directly to an element and its used by java scripts .
    </p>
    <p> in CSS , selectors are used to target a specific element a range of element on aweb page . once an element has
        been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied ellement there is a wide range of selector available .
        two of the most commenly used are theclass and ID . both are used to target element to which a style should be
        applied </p>

The outer space of an element i.e. margin is the space outside the border.	The inner space of an element i.e.padding is space inside the elementâ€™s border.

margin & padding :
When you want to give margin to any HTML element then the spacing will get created from the border of the element to its parent element.
When we are giving padding to any element which means spacing will be created between the content and the parent border
